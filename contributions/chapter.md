## Issue #925
[Issue #925](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues/925) is marked as "Good first issue" by the maintainers of loopback-next. 
In the description of the issue, one of the developers proposes a fix for moving the start error handling from the main function to the main index file. 
The fix proposed by the developer has been implemented and successfully tested using the build in tests.

We submitted a pull request [PR #1151](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/1151) to loopback-next according to the LoopBack guidelines.
After dealing with the code linter and some small required changed proposed by the developers it was approved.
Three of the developers (of which one code owner) approved it and it was merged 3 days after submitting it.

## Issue #1218
While analysing the code structure for technical debt we proposed a change of the package structure in [issue #1218](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues/1218).
Coincidently one of the code owners also thought of the same change just before we submitted the issue.
The developer looking at our submitted issue asked if we wanted to submit a pull request for this issue.

Since it seemed to be a very simple change we started working on the pull request.
Unfortunately it was a more complex issue requiring changing of several configuration files, some documentation changes and a small change in the code.
Eventually we were able to fix all problems and submitted [pull request #1231](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/1231) which is waiting for approval.
